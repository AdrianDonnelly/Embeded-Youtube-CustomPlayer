# Embedded-YouTube-CustomPlayer

Custom player for YouTube videos on a website where the YouTube icon is not desired.

# Overview

This project uses YouTube's IFrame API and JavaScript to create a custom player for embedding YouTube videos. The primary function is to generate a play button using the video's thumbnail, which seamlessly transitions to playing the video when pressed.
